# Solar-MPPT-Emergency-AC-Load-Balancing-System
This project focuses on enhancing household power output and reliability of a DC-AC solar panel emergency back up power system. Traditional PWM-based solar charge controllers often struggle to produce sufficient power, especially under varying temperature conditions, due to their inability to dynamically adjust voltage and current for optimal efficiency. The solution presented here utilizes relay switches and inverter load balancing techniques to improve energy output and maximize solar panel efficiency.

## Problem Statement
PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) controllers are widely used in solar charge regulation but are limited by their inability to effectively handle variations in environmental conditions, such as temperature and sunlight. Some use current limiting resistors or filters to induce a delay, although a cheap method it is highly dangerous to do so for long term use thus, these limitations result in lower efficiency, leading to insufficient power generation. A more dynamic, adaptive system is required to overcome these inefficiencies and make the most of solar energy and DC power available from a Lead ACID or Lithium based battery.

## Solution Approach
The project proposes a low cost approach by integrating relay switches, pwm timers, and inverter load balancing into the solar power system. This setup enables more precise control over power distribution, improving energy harvesting and optimizing the performance of the solar panel across different environmental conditions.

## Usage
1. Once the hardware is set up properly, the system will begin tracking the maximum power point of the solar panel.
2. Relay switches will automatically adjust switching from battery powered DC-AC to Mains AC load using an adjustable timer, this should ensure a stable inverter AC output especially within unstable conditions (Can cause Arcing on Relay if not careful).
3. The system will dynamically respond to temperature variations and other environmental factors to optimize power generation.

## Potential Future Upgrades
1. Power monitoring and automation control via an IoT Edge based Microcontroller with ML integration.
2. Mitigation of capacitive and inductive loads at higher currents to prevent spikes or conditions that may damage components in the chain like DC-AC Inverters not rated at higher current limits.
3. Integration of robust embedded tools and electronics to guarantee stability and reliability for long term use.
4. Design of custom circuitry for maximum performance and remote operation.
